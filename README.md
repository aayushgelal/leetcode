This is a leetcode clone web app. We are given a few problems and a place to write the code. When we submit the code, it is sent to CHATGPT to check whether the written code is correct or not. According to that ChatGpt provides us the solution for the problem.

Note: I have not focused on UI. It is more about functionality than UI. But according to the time you are watching this project, The ChatGpt API might have been expired. So I have a video on how its working in the current time. Also i am using the free server so it might be slow. It will take some time to load.
